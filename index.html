    Hi, I’m L. You’re probably here because you’re considering hiring me. Here’s three big reasons why you should:
<ol>
    <li>
        As a graduate of Grace Hopper (Fullstack), I am self-motivated, excited by new challenges, and enjoy quickly learning new tools and skills on-the-job. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, as well as front and back end specific languages such as React  and PostgreSQL. I turned an early homework assignment on DOM manipulation into Heart Attack, an anxious clicker game.  I then built my own CRUD app, and collaborated with a team of 3 other developers to build an e-commerce site with the same structure. During this project, I specialized in data structures, as well as fullstack calls, using React, Redux. For my capstone project, I was one of 4 developers of Hace Gropper, an educational game about Women in STEM. II built out the Technology room using, taught my team members how to take advantage of windows storage, and used CSS flexbox Combining aspects of all my larger projects, I created another clicker game about mental health, double depression. I am currently working on a web app for school psychologists that integrates Google oauth2 and calendar API to help keep track of state-specified IEP deadlines.

        As someone with a masters in school psych, I recognize the dynamic systems of the workplace, and have built strong transferable skills of giving and receiving feedback, collaboration, empathy, and self-reflection. I have 10 years of experience collaborating successfully with children, their adults, and their teachers to promote holistic growth and development on a community and individual scale. In addition, I specialized in social equity, co-authored the anti-racism, and was the founding member of the School Psychology Advocacy Collective for [Racial/Social] Equity (SPACE)  based on collectivist principles. I created and presented a professional development seminar about implementing active anti-racism in schools, and wrote my thesis on queering the classroom space. 
    </li>

        As a former summer camp supervisor (in-person), a job I loved and thrived in, I am excellent at managing a fast-paced environment with many deadlines, while still making individual connections and uplifting others. I was responsible for writing and delivering performance reviews for 4-9 teenage counselors, connecting with parents, and collaborating with a team of 6 other supervisors to. I was voted best bus-site supervisor, and built relationships with families that I work with to this day. 
    </li>
</ol>
These three strengths together are what make me a unique asset for any company. I bring both hard technical skills and a sense of community everywhere I go. I chose to become a software engineer because I believe this is where I can make the most impact while using critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving skills,and collaborating  with others to
